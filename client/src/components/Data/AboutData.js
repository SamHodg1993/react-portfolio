    info: `First and foremost, I'm a geek. You can often find me messing about with something, right now it's Go and Vim (shocker... I know ðŸ˜œ), 
        there is always something that I'm learning or just messing about with. <br /><br/> For the past year, I have been a solo full stack developer 
        creating a vulnerability management tool for Razorthorn security. I have also been involved in creating other production solutions, some of which 
        are mentioned below in my Portfolio section. <br /><br /> If you would like to know 
        more, you can either look at the other about me section by using the arrows above, alternatively, you can look at my Portfolio below...<br /><br />

    // info: `For the past 10 years I have led an interesting life, starting out as an Infantryman in 
    //         the British Army and more recently a Truck Driver in Scotland. All the while I have been
    //         persuing my passion for tech and devleoping. Having a career as a developer never really occurred to me, it was alyways just 
    //         a hobby Currently I am most confident devleoping in React and Typescript using Redux for 
    //         state management. However my list of competencies is forever growing. If you like what

    info: `I have always held an intrest for tech, even as a mop headed teen &#128513;. My first notable 
        involvement in tech was when I was around 15 years old. I got my first  iPhone, the 'iPhone 5'. I 
        gained 'Jailbreak' status and loved exploring the mod stores, installing new launchers and 
        customising to my hearts content. <br/><br /> One of my absolute favourite mods added cursor scroll functionality to the default keyboards 
        spacebar. Nowadays, this is a common feature, but back then, to me, this was a game changer.
        This spurred on a thirst for knowledge, to learn how tech worked and how I could become
        an 'iPhone modder'!`

        At which time I was placed in 2 Scots, Royal Regiment of Scotland (Royal Higland Fusiliers). Here I was placed in the Motor Transport Platoon and 
        focussed on becoming a driving instructor. Training soldiers to drive in a range of military vehicles in challenging environments, competently and safely.
