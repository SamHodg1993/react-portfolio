        info: `For the past 10 years I have led an interesting life, starting out as an Infantryman in 
            the British Army and more recently a Truck Driver in Scotland. All the while I have been
            persuing my passion for tech and devleoping. Having a career as a developer never really occurred to me, it was alyways just 
            a hobby Currently I am most confident devleoping in React and Typescript using Redux for 
            state management. However my list of competencies is forever growing. <br /><br />If you like what

        info: `I have always held an intrest for tech, even as a mop headed teen &#128513;. My first notable 
        involvement in tech was when I was around 15 years old. I got my first  iPhone, the 'iPhone 5'. I 
        gained 'Jailbreak' status and loved exploring the mod stores, installing new launchers and 
        customising to my hearts content. \n One of my absolute favourite mods added cursor scroll functionality to the default keyboards 
        spacebar. Nowadays, this is a common feature, but back then, to me, this was a game changer.
        This spurred on a thirst for knowledge, to learn how tech worked and how I could become
        an 'iPhone modder'!`

        England, I moved to my first Battalion, 5 Scots, Royal Regiment of Scotland (The Argyle and Sutheland Highlanders).5 Scots were disbanded in 2013. At which time I was placed in 2 Scots, Royal Regiment of Scotland (Royal Higland
