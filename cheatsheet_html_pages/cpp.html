          <code>std::endl</code> manipulator to insert a newline character at the end of the output.

    <h2>About C++</h2>
    <p>
      C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded
      significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
    </p>

    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p>
      C++ is a statically-typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, compiled, general-purpose programming language. It is regarded as an intermediate-level language, as it comprises a
      combination of both high-level and low-level language features.
    </p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as
      its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,
      including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>
      C++ is a statically-typed, free-form, (usually) compiled, multi-paradigm, intermediate-level general-purpose programming language. C++ is regarded as a middle-level language,
      as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New
      Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.
